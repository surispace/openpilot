# NRDR documentation

Current design and operating references live with the package that owns the
code:

- [Architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md) defines dependency direction and the
  integration-seam rules.
- [Parameter migration](PARAM_MIGRATION.md) documents safe registry lifecycle
  changes.
- [Predictive lateral stiction](LATERAL_STICTION.md) documents the current
  stiction overlay.
- [Driver override hold](DRIVER_OVERRIDE_HOLD.md) documents the wait-before-
  re-engage setting that prevents steering vibration during driver override.
- [Honda Bosch-A radar](RADAR_EXPERIMENTAL.md) documents the experimental
  factory-radar decoder and its operating limits.
- [Radar reverse engineering](../tools/radar_re/README.md) documents the
  offline Bosch radar analysis tools.

The [`history`](history/) directory contains dated handoffs, retired branch
runbooks, and snapshots retained for provenance. They are not current device
instructions.
